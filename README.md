# Hepatocellular Carcinoma Machine Learning Application

Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) Analysis Application

This application is designed for the analysis of Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) datasets, providing insights and predictive modeling for this critical medical condition. The dataset, named "hcc-data," is a comprehensive collection of attributes relevant to HCC. Additionally, the project includes a dataset description file, "hcc-description," offering detailed information on the dataset's title, source, past usage, relevant attributes, and class distribution.

### Features:
Dataset Analysis: Gain insights into the characteristics of HCC patients through exploratory data analysis.
Predictive Modeling: Utilize machine learning algorithms to build predictive models for patient survival and other relevant outcomes.
Matlab Integration: Access the dataset in Matlab format ("hcc.mat") for seamless integration with Matlab-based analysis tools.
Codebase: Includes a concise Matlab script (hcc_analysis.m) for reading the dataset, preprocessing, and conducting analysis.

### Usage:
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Open apk.m in Matlab.
Run the script to load the dataset, preprocess, and conduct analysis.
